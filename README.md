# Pegdle - Daily Peg Solitaire Puzzle

Pegdle is a daily puzzle game inspired by Wordle and Nerdle, bringing the classic Peg Solitaire game into a fun, bite-sized daily challenge format. Each day, players around the world face the same puzzle, trying to clear the board with strategic jumps while using the minimum number of moves.

## üéÆ Game Overview

- **Daily Challenge**: A new puzzle each day, the same for all players
- **Multiple Board Types**: Classic English, European, Triangle, and Mini layouts
- **Difficulty Levels**: Adjustable for casual and expert play
- **Score Tracking**: Compare your performance against personal bests
- **Responsive Design**: Play on any device

## üöÄ How to Play

1. Jump pegs over each other to remove them from the board
2. A peg can jump over an adjacent peg into an empty hole
3. The jumped peg is removed
4. Try to clear the board, leaving only one peg
5. Challenge yourself to solve each puzzle in the minimum number of moves!

## üíª Technical Setup

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Project Structure

The code is organized into the following structure:

- `/src` - Main source code
  - `/components` - React components
    - `/modals` - Modal dialog components
  - `/hooks` - Custom React hooks
  - `/utils` - Utility functions and constants
  - `/styles` - Styling modules

Key components:
- `App.js` - Main application component
- `components/GameBoard.js` - Game board rendering and interaction
- `components/Cell.js` - Individual board cell component
- `components/Particles.js` - Particle effects for captured pegs
- `components/Confetti.js` - Celebration effects for victories
- `components/GameControls.js` - Game controls UI
- `components/modals/VictoryModal.js` - Victory celebration and sharing
- `hooks/useGameBoard.js` - Game board state and logic
- `hooks/useDailyChallenge.js` - Daily challenge generation and management
- `hooks/useGameState.js` - Overall game state including limited hints
- `utils/boardConfigs.js` - Board layouts and difficulty settings
- `utils/gameUtils.js` - Game logic and intelligent hint system
- `utils/storageUtils.js` - Local storage caching for persistence

### Performance Optimizations

The code includes several optimizations to ensure smooth gameplay:

1. **Component Memoization** - React.memo is used for all components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
2. **Local Storage Caching** - Daily challenges are cached to avoid regeneration on page refresh
3. **Efficient State Management** - Custom hooks separate concerns and minimize state updates
4. **Optimized Animations** - CSS animations use hardware acceleration and avoid layout thrashing
5. **Batch Updates** - State updates are batched where possible to reduce render cycles
6. **User Preference Persistence** - Settings like difficulty level are saved between sessions
7. **Lazy Initialization** - Heavy calculations are deferred until needed
8. **Throttled Events** - Drag events are throttled to improve performance

### Available Scripts

- `npm start` - Runs the app in development mode
- `npm test` - Launches the test runner
- `npm run build` - Builds the app for production
